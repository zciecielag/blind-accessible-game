## About the game
You play as a cat who was woken up from his nap. You discover that there are birthday preparations underway for a family member - and the only way for you to go back to sleep is to help speed the process up!

Find objects, unlock doors, and talk to the home-dwellers to prepare the best birthday party this household has ever seen.
